                                <p>Before the Viking launches in the mid-1970s, our knowledge of Mars was extremely limited. The team of scientists assembled for the Viking project had to figure out how to land and navigate a spacecraft on a planet with almost no prior knowledge of what the surface would be like. Prior to the Viking missions, the Soviets had tried to land spacecrafts on Mars, and although one of their crafts seems to have made it to the surface, it lost contact with Earth before landing and may have crashed.</p>
                                <p>Tthe Viking project, however, was an amazing success. The Viking program, of which the lander was a part, gathered data and images about our nearest planetary neighbor that changed the way we see Mars. In fact, before Viking, scientists thought the Martian sky would be a deep blue, like our upper atmosphere, but early photos from Viking revealed Mars's salmon-colored sky for the first time.</p>
